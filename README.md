# STEP (Scholarly Text-Editing Platform)
# How to Access a Transcription Document (STEP)?

Three pathways are available for your exploration: one leads to the platform, and two lead to documentation about two STEP applications. Several companion applications, called STEP Tools, are being developed to facilitate and strengthen STEP's usability, although all can be used independently as well. They work on both the Mac and Windows platforms. Some of their key functionalities will be made eventually available through web applications inside the platform.

1. Explore the demo version of our Scholarly Text Editing Platform. You will be asked for a username and password. 
2. Explore STEP Transcriptor (v. 2.0), a comprehensive TEI-XML compliant transcription app that makes TEI encoding a breeze. 
3. Explore STEP Text Comparator, a versatile app that, when fully developed, will help create well-formed apparatus lists (alterations, emendations, rejected substantives, collation data, errata) automatically.

Be aware that this demo site is under constant development. Interface design and appearance keep improving all the time. Other STEP Tools in the works include STEP Image Viewer, STEP Emendator, STEP Annotator, and STEP Formulator.
